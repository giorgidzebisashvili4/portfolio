      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hello! I’m a blend of creativity and technology, transitioning from a
        vibrant career in graphic design to the ever-evolving world of web
        development. My background in business management and years of
        self-taught graphic design have equipped me with a diverse skill set.
        I've created compelling visuals across various platforms and industries,
        utilizing tools like Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, After Effects, and
        Figma. Driven by a passion for continuous learning, I've recently
        expanded my expertise into software development, completing a course in
        React.js. This new journey leverages my design acumen, allowing me to
        integrate user-centric designs with functional development. I’m
        adaptable, quick to learn, and eager to apply my skills in a full-stack
        developer role. I’m looking for opportunities to blend my creative
        design and technical skills to create impactful digital solutions. Let’s
        connect and explore the possibilities together.
